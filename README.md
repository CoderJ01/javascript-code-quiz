# JavaScript Coding Quiz

## Purpose

The objective of this website is to quiz the website user on the programming language of JavaScript. The responder must answer ten questions. The responsder is given 10 seconds for each question. If the time runs out before the responder answers a question, then the quiz will be over. After the quiz is finished, the responder can manually save the score by typing a pair of initials (or a name if prefered) and the score next to said initials.

 ## Challenges 

 The quiz functions sufficiently. Nevertheless, I will design the quiz to be able to automatically keep the score once I improve my JavaScript programming skills. I will also engineer the quiz to subtract time should the responder select an incorrect answer.
